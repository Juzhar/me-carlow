More accurate battles:

One thing about actual pokemon battles compared to the ones that we made in this final project is that they a 1 on 1 with each pokemon and it goes down the line of each trainers pokemon until a trainer runs our of pokemon rather the composite of a team. In my head I imagine it consisting of a list of each teams pokemon and it starts with the first in each of their lists, then it will measure the those pokemon experiences, and whichever one is greater wins, which will cause it to fight the next pokemon in the list, however with a little bit of battle damage, as for each time a pokemon wins, their strength will go down by 10 points, and this process will continue to be repeated until one team has no more pokemon left

Another core feature of the pokemon games is the type effectiveness/weakness. Going back to my previous idea of pokemon battling each other 1 on 1, this could be expanded by including a pokemons type in their data table. If I manage to get the previous idea working, this will further make the battles more dynamic and interactive, as when a pokemon will face another, their types will be evaluated and it will run through a dataframe containing all the possible type match ups and add a multiplier to the experience of the pokemon who does have the type advantage

Even though both of these are solid ideas I have, I would ultimately not decide to do this as imagining doing the code for how one pokemon will go after the other will get very confusing, and the fact that trying to implement every type effectiveness/weakness would be very repetitive and time consuming
